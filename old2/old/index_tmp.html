<h2 class=h2_style>Research Interests</h2>

<div style="text-align:justify">
<p>
I study <b>deep learning</b> models for <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b>. My research aims to make NLP technology more <b>efficient</b> and <span style='color:green'><b>green</b></span>, in order to decrease the environmental impact of the field, as well as lower the cost of AI research in order to broden participation in it. <br>
My research is also driven towards making text understanding technology widely accessibleâ€”to doctors, to teachers, to researchers or even to curious teenagers. To be broadly adopted, NLP technology needs to not only be accurate, but also reliable: models should provide explanations for their outputs; and the methods we use to evaluate them need to be convincing. 
My research addresses these two challenges: I develop <b>theories</b> that <b>explain</b> deep learning algorithms for NLP, and I seek ways to <b>improve their evaluation</b>.

I am a research scientist at the <a href="http://allennlp.org/" target="_blank">AllenNLP team</a> at <a href="http://allenai.org/index.html" target="_blank">the Allen institute for Artificial intelligence</a> and at <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/" target="_blank">the computer science and engineering department</a> at <a href="http://www.washington.edu/" target="_blank">The University of Washington</a>. 
	I will be joining  <a href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il" target="_blank">the School of Computer Science and Engineering</a> faculty
of <a href="http://www.huji.ac.il/" target="_blank">The Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a> in September 2020.  
<br>
I completed my Ph.D. at <a href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il" target="_blank">the School of Computer Science and Engineering</a>
of <a href="http://www.huji.ac.il/" target="_blank">The Hebrew University of Jerusalem</a>, where I worked with <a href="http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~arir" target="_blank">Prof. Ari Rappoport</a>.
In 2011, I graduated my masters degree (<b>magna cum laude</b>) in computer science, under the supervision of 
Prof. Ari Rappoport [<script>URL('papers/roy_schwartz_thesis_final.pdf','dissertation')</script>]. 
Prior to that, I studied computer science and cognitive sciences at the Hebrew University, and
completed my B.Sc. (<b>magna cum laude</b>) in 2008. 
I was a member of the Amirim program for outstanding undergraduate students. 
In 2004-2005, I was a software engineer at <a href="http://www.checkpoint.com/" target="_blank">Check Point Ltd.</a>
