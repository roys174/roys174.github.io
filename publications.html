Fine-tuning pretrained contextual word embedding models to supervised downstream tasks has become commonplace in natural language processing. This process, however, is often brittle: even with the same hyperparameter values, distinct random seeds can lead to substantially different results. To better understand this phenomenon, we experiment with four datasets from the GLUE benchmark, fine-tuning BERT hundreds of times on each while varying only the random seeds. We find substantial performance increases compared to previously reported results, and we quantify how the performance of the best-found model varies as a function of the number of fine-tuning trials. Further, we examine two factors influenced by the choice of random seed: weight initialization and training data order. We find that both contribute comparably to the variance of out-of-sample performance, and that some weight initializations perform well across all tasks explored. On small datasets, we observe that many fine-tuning trials diverge part of the way through training, and we offer best practices for practitioners to stop training less promising runs early. We publicly release all of our experimental data, including training and validation scores for 2,100 trials, to encourage further analysis of training dynamics during fine-tuning.

The computations required for deep learning research have been doubling every few months, resulting in an estimated 300,000x increase from 2012 to 2018 [2]. These computations have a surprisingly large carbon footprint [38]. Ironically, deep learning was inspired by the human brain, which is remarkably energy efficient. Moreover, the financial cost of the computations can make it difficult for academics, students, and researchers, in particular those from emerging economies, to engage in deep learning research. 
<br>
This position paper advocates a practical solution by making <b>efficiency</b> an evaluation criterion for research alongside accuracy and related measures. In addition, we propose reporting the financial cost or "price tag" of developing, training, and running models to provide baselines for the investigation of increasingly efficient methods. Our goal is to make AI both greener and more inclusive---enabling any inspired undergraduate with a laptop to write high-quality research papers. <span style='color:green'>Green AI</span> is an emerging focus at the Allen Institute for AI.

Research in natural language processing proceeds, in part, by demonstrating that new models achieve superior performance (e.g.,  accuracy) on held-out test data,  compared to previous  results.   In  this  paper,  we  demonstrate that test-set performance scores alone are insufficient  for  drawing  accurate  conclusions about which model performs best.  We argue for reporting additional details, especially performance  on  validation  data  obtained  during model development.  We present a novel technique  for  doing  so: <i>expected  validation  performance</i> of the best-found model as a function  of  computation  budget  (i.e.,  the  number of hyperparameter search trials or the overall training  time).   Using  our  approach,  we  findmultiple recent model comparisons where authors would have reached a different conclusion  if  they  had  used  more  (or  less)  computation. Our  approach  also  allows  us  to  estimate  the  amount  of  computation  required  to obtain a given accuracy; applying it to several recently published results yields massive variation across papers, from hours to weeks.  We conclude with a set of best practices for reporting  experimental  results  which  allow  for robust future comparisons, and provide code to allow researchers to use our technique.

Neural models for NLP typically use large numbers of parameters to reach state-of-the- art performance, which can lead to excessive memory usage and increased runtime. We present a structure learning method for learning sparse, parameter-efficient NLP models. Our method applies group lasso to rational RNNs (Peng et al., 2018), a family of models that is closely connected to weighted finite-state automata (WFSAs). We take advantage of rational RNNsâ€™ natural grouping of the weights, so the group lasso penalty directly removes WFSA states, substantially reducing the number of parameters in the model. Our experiments on a number of sentiment analysis datasets, using both GloVe and BERT embeddings, show that our approach learns neural structures which have fewer parameters without sacrificing performance relative to parameter-rich baselines. Our method also highlights the interpretable properties of rational RNNs. We show that sparsifying such models makes them easier to visualize, and we present models that rely exclusively on as few as three WFSAs after pruning more than 90% of the weights. We publicly release our code.

We present PaLM, a hybrid <b>p</b>arser and neural <b>l</b>anguage <b>m</b>odel. Building on an RNN language model, PaLM adds an attention layer over text spans in the left context. An unsupervised constituency parser can be derived from its attention weights, using a greedy decoding algorithm. We evaluate PaLM on language modeling, and empirically show that it outperforms strong baselines. If syntactic annotations are available, the attention component can be trained in a supervised manner, providing syntactically-informed representations of the context, and further improving language modeling performance.

Contextual word representations, typically trained on unstructured, unlabeled text, do not contain any explicit grounding to real world entities and are often unable to remember facts about those entities. We propose a general method to embed multiple knowledge bases(KBs) into large scale models, and there by enhance their representations with structured, human-curated knowledge. For each KB, we first use an integrated entity linker to retrieve relevant entity embeddings, then update contextual word representations via a form of word-to-entity attention. In contrast to previous approaches, the entity linkers and self-supervised language modeling objective are jointly trained end-to-end in a multitask setting that combines a small amount of entity linking supervision with a large amount of raw text. After integrating WordNet and a subset of Wikipedia into BERT, the knowledge enhanced BERT (KnowBert) demonstrates improved perplexity, ability to recall facts as measured in a probing task and downstream performance on relationship extraction, entity typing, and word sense disambiguation. KnowBertâ€™s runtime is comparable to BERTâ€™sand it scales to large KBs.

Several datasets have recently been constructed to expose brittleness in models trained on existing benchmarks.
While model performance on these <i>challenge datasets</i> is significantly lower compared to the original benchmark, it is unclear what particular weaknesses they reveal.
For example, a challenge dataset may be difficult because it targets phenomena that current models cannot capture, or because it simply exploits blind spots in a model's specific training set.
We introduce <i>inoculation by fine-tuning</i>, a new analysis method for studying challenge datasets by exposing models (the metaphorical patient) to a small amount of data from the challenge dataset (a metaphorical pathogen) and assessing how well they can adapt.
We apply our method to analyze the NLI "stress tests" (Naik et al., 2018) and the Adversarial SQuAD dataset (Jia and Liang,2017).
We show that after slight exposure, some of these datasets are no longer challenging, while others remain difficult. Our results indicate that failures on challenge datasets may lead to very different conclusions about models, training datasets, and the challenge datasets themselves.

Despite the tremendous empirical success of neural models in natural language processing, many of them lack the strong intuitions that accompany classical machine learning approaches. Recently, connections have been shown between convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and weighted finite state automata (WFSAs), leading to new interpretations and insights. In this work, we show that some recurrent neural networks also share this connection to WFSAs. We characterize this connection formally, defining rational recurrences to be recurrent hidden state update functions that can be written as the Forward calculation of a finite set of WFSAs. We show that several recent neural models use rational recurrences. Our analysis provides a fresh view of these models and facilitates devising new neural architectures that draw inspiration from WFSAs. We present one such model, which performs better than two recent baselines on language modeling and text classification. Our results demonstrate that transferring intuitions from classical models like WFSAs can be an effective approach to designing and understanding neural models.

Given a partial description like "she opened the hood of the car", humans can reason about the situation and anticipate what might come next ("then, she examined the engine"). In this paper, we introduce the task of grounded commonsense inference, unifying natural language inference and commonsense reasoning.<br>We present SWAG, a new dataset with 113k multiple choice questions about a rich spectrum of grounded situations. To address the recurring challenges of the annotation artifacts and human biases found in many existing datasets, we propose Adversarial Filtering (AF), a novel procedure that constructs a de-biased dataset by iteratively training an ensemble of stylistic classifiers, and using them to filter the data. To account for the aggressive adversarial filtering, we use state-of-the-art language models to massively oversample a diverse set of potential counterfactuals. Empirical results demonstrate that while humans can solve the resulting inference problems with high accuracy (88%), various competitive models struggle on our task. We provide comprehensive analysis that indicates significant opportunities for future research.

Recurrent and convolutional neural networks comprise two distinct families of models that have proven to be useful for encoding natural language utterances.
In this paper we present SoPa, a new model that aims to bridge these two approaches. 
SoPa combines neural representation learning with weighted finite-state automata (WFSAs) to learn a soft version of traditional surface patterns. 
We show that SoPa is an extension of a one-layer CNN, and that such CNNs are equivalent to a restricted version of SoPa, and accordingly, to a restricted form of WFSA. 
Empirically, on three text classification tasks, SoPa is comparable or better than both a BiLSTM (RNN) baseline and a CNN baseline, and is particularly useful in small data settings.

While recurrent neural networks have found success in a variety of natural language processing applications, they are general models of sequential data. We investigate how the properties of natural language data affect an LSTMâ€™s ability to learn a nonlinguistic task: recalling elements from its input. We find that models trained on natural language data are able to recall tokens from much longer sequences than models trained on non-language sequential data. Furthermore, we show that the LSTM learns to solve the memorization task by explicitly using a subset of its neurons to count timesteps in the input. We hypothesize that the patterns and structure in natural language data enable LSTMs to learn by providing approximate ways of reducing loss, but understanding the effect of different training data on the learnability of LSTMs remains an open question.

Peer reviewing is a central component in the scientific publishing process.
We present the first public dataset of scientific peer reviews available for research purposes (PeerRead v1) providing an opportunity to study this important artifact.
The dataset consists of 14K paper drafts and the corresponding accept/reject decisions in top-tier venues including ACL, NIPS and ICLR. 
The dataset also includes 8.7K textual peer reviews written by experts for a subset of the papers.
We describe the data collection process and report interesting observedÂ phenomena in the peer reviews.
We also propose two novel NLP tasks based on this dataset and provide simple baseline models.
In the first task, we show that simple models can predict whether a paper is accepted with up to 21% error reduction compared to the majority baseline.
In the second task, we predict the numerical scores of review aspects and show that simple models can outperform the mean baseline for aspects with high variance such as 'originality' and 'impact'.

Large-scale datasets for natural language inference are created by presenting crowd workers with a sentence (premise), and asking them to generate three new sentences (hypotheses) that it entails, contradicts, or is logically neutral with respect to. 
We show that, in a significant portion of such data, this protocol leaves clues that make it possible to identify the label by looking only at the hypothesis, without observing the premise. 
Specifically, we show that a simple text categorization model can correctly classify the hypothesis alone in about 67% of SNLI (Bowman et al., 2015) and 53% of MultiNLI (Williams et al., 2018).
Our analysis reveals that specific linguistic phenomena such as negation and vagueness are highly correlated with certain inference classes. 
Our findings suggest that the success of natural language inference models to date has been overestimated, and that the task remains a hard open problem.

A writer's style depends not just on personal traits but also on her intent and mental state. In this paper, we show how variants of the same writing task can lead to measurable differences in writing style. We present a case study based on the story cloze task (Mostafazadeh et al., 2016a), where annotators were assigned similar writing tasks with different constraints: (1) writing an entire story, (2) adding a story ending for a given story context, and (3) adding an incoherent ending to a story. We show that a simple linear classifier informed by stylistic features is able to successfully distinguish among the three cases, without even looking at the story context. In addition, combining our stylistic features with language model predictions reaches state of the art performance on the story cloze challenge. Our results demonstrate that different task framings can dramatically affect the way people write.

This paper is concerned with identifying contexts useful for training word representation models for different word classes such as adjectives (A), verbs (V), and nouns (N). We introduce a simple yet effective framework for an automatic selection of class-specific context configurations. We construct a context configuration space based on universal dependency relations between words, and efficiently search this space with an adapted beam search algorithm. In word similarity tasks for each word class, we show that our framework is both effective and efficient. Particularly, it improves the Spearman's rho correlation with human scores on SimLex-999 over the best previously proposed class-specific contexts by 6 (A), 6 (V) and 5 (N) rho points. With our selected context configurations, we train on only 14% (A), 26.2% (V), and 33.6% (N) of all dependency-based contexts, resulting in a reduced training time. Our results generalise: we show that the configurations our algorithm learns for one English training setup outperform previously proposed context types in another training setup for English. Moreover, basing the configuration space on universal dependencies, it is possible to transfer the learned configurations to German and Italian. We also demonstrate improved per-class results over other context types in these two languages.

This paper describes University of Washington NLP's submission for the Linking Models of Lexical, Sentential and Discourse-level Semantics (LSDSem 2017) shared task&mdash;the Story Cloze Task. Our system is a linear classifier with a variety of features, including both the scores of a neural language model and style features. We report 75.2% accuracy on the task. A further discussion of our results can be found in Schwartz et al. (2017).

State-of-the-art word embeddings, which are often trained on bag-of-words (BOW) contexts, provide a high quality representation of aspects of the semantics of nouns. 
However, their quality decreases substantially for the task of verb similarity prediction. 
In this paper we show that using symmetric pattern contexts (SPs, e.g., ``X and Y'') 
improves word2vec verb similarity performance by up to 15% and is also instrumental in adjective similarity prediction. 
The unsupervised SP contexts are even superior to a variety of dependency contexts extracted using a supervised dependency parser. 
Moreover, we observe that SPs and dependency coordination contexts (Coor) capture a similar type of information, 
and demonstrate that Coor contexts are superior to other dependency contexts including the set of all dependency contexts, 
although they are still inferior to SPs.
Finally, there are substantially fewer SP contexts compared to alternative representations,
leading to a massive reduction in training time. 
On an 8G words corpus and a 32 core machine, the SP model trains in 11 minutes,
compared to 5 and 11 hours with BOW and all dependency contexts, respectively.

We present a novel word level vector representation based on symmetric patterns (SPs). For this aim we automatically acquire SPs (e.g., "X and Y") from a large corpus of plain text, and generate vectors where each coordinate represents the co-occurrence in SPs of the represented word with another word of the vocabulary. Our representation has three advantages over existing alternatives: First, being based on symmetric word relationships, it is highly suitable for word similarity prediction. Particularly, on the SimLex999 word similarity dataset, our model achieves a Spearman's &#961; score of 0.517, compared to 0.462 of the state-of-the-art word2vec model. Interestingly, our model performs exceptionally well on verbs, outperforming state-of-the-art baselines by 20.2&#x2012;41.5%. Second, pattern features can be adapted to the needs of a target NLP application. For example, we show that we can easily control whether the embeddings derived from SPs deem antonym pairs (e.g. (big,small)) as similar or dissimilar, an important distinction for tasks such as word classification and sentiment analysis. Finally, we show that a simple combination of the word similarity scores generated by our method and by word2vec results in a superior predictive power over that of each individual model, scoring as high as 0.563 in Spearman's &#961; on SimLex999. This emphasizes the differences between the signals captured by each of the models.

In recent years, distributional models (DMs) have shown great success in representing lexical semantics. 
In this work we show that the extent to which DMs represent semantic knowledge is highly dependent on the type of knowledge. 
We pose the task of predicting properties of concrete nouns in a supervised setting, and compare between learning taxonomic properties (e.g., animacy) and attributive properties (e.g., size, color). 
We employ four state-of-the-art DMs as sources of feature representation for this task, and show that they all yield poor results when tested on attributive properties, achieving no more than an average F-score of 0.37 in the binary property prediction task, compared to 0.73 on taxonomic properties. Our results suggest that the distributional hypothesis may not be equally applicable to all types of semantic information.

Classifying nouns into semantic categories (e.g., animals, food) is an important line of research in both cognitive science and natural language processing. We present a minimally supervised model for noun classification, which uses symmetric patterns (e.g., "X and Y") and an iterative variant of the k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm. Unlike most previous works, we do not use a predefined set of symmetric patterns, but extract them automatically from plain text, in an unsupervised manner. We experiment with four semantic categories and show that symmetric patterns constitute much better classification features compared to leading word embedding methods. We further demonstrate that our simple k-Nearest Neighbors algorithm outperforms two state-of-the-art label propagation alternatives for this task. In experiments, our model obtains 82%-94% accuracy using as few as four labeled examples per category, emphasizing the effectiveness of simple search and representation techniques for this task.

Work on authorship attribution has traditionally focused on long texts. In this work, we tackle the question of whether the author of a very short text can be successfully identified. We use Twitter as an experimental testbed. We introduce the concept of an author's unique "signature", and show that such signatures are typical of many authors when writing very short texts. We also present a new authorship attribution feature ("flexible patterns") and demonstrate a significant improvement over our baselines. Our results show that the author of a single tweet can be identified with good accuracy in an array of flavors of the authorship attribution task.

There is often more than one way to represent syntactic structures, even within a given formalism. Selecting one representation over another may affect parsing performance. Therefore, selecting between alternative syntactic representations (henceforth, syntactic selection) is an essential step in designing an annotation scheme. We present a methodology for syntactic selection and apply it to six central dependency structures. Our methodology compares pairs of annotation schemes that differ in the annotation of a single structure. It selects the more learnable scheme, namely the one that can be better learned using statistical parsers. We find that in three of the structures, one annotation is unequivocally better than the alternatives. Our results are consistent over various settings involving five parsers and two definitions of learnability. Furthermore, we show that the learnability gains incurred by our selections are both considerable (error reductions of up to 19.8%) and additive. The contribution of this work is in demonstrating that syntactic selection has a substantial and predictable effect on parsing performance, and showing that this effect can be effectively used in designing syntactic annotation schemes.

Dependency parsing is a central NLP task. In this paper we show that the common evaluation for unsupervised dependency parsing is highly sensitive to problematic annotations. We show that for three leading unsupervised parsers (Klein and Manning, 2004; Cohen and Smith, 2009; Spitkovsky et al., 2010a), a small set of parameters can be found whose modification yields a significant improvement in standard evaluation measures. These parameters correspond to local cases where no linguistic consensus exists as to the proper gold annotation. Therefore, the standard evaluation does not provide a true indication of algorithm quality. We present a new measure, Neutral Edge Direction (NED), and show that it greatly reduces this undesired phenomenon.
