<p>

Our lab studies <b>Natural Language Processing (NLP)</b>.
Our research is driven towards making text understanding technology widely accessible—to doctors, to teachers, to researchers or even to curious teenagers. 
To be broadly adopted, NLP technology needs to not only be accurate, but also <b>reliable</b>: models should run efficiently on models should provide explanations for their outputs; and the methods we use to evaluate them need to be convincing.
<br>
Our lab also studies methods to make NLP technology more <b>efficient</b> and <span style='color:black'><b>green</b></span>, in order to decrease the environmental impact of the field, as well as lower the cost of AI research in order to broden participation in it. <br>
<!-- My research addresses these two challenges: I develop <b>theories</b> that <b>explain</b> deep learning algorithms for NLP, and I seek ways to <b>improve their evaluation</b>. 
Recent advances in NLP have resulted in large models, containing as many as billions of parameters, 
that are trained on large datasets.

These models are to understand, interpret, and explain.  -->

				<p align='justify'>The computations required for deep learning research have been doubling every few months. These computations have a <b>surprisingly large carbon footprint</b>.  
					Moreover, the financial cost of the computations can make it difficult for academics, students, and researchers, in particular those from emerging economies, to engage in deep learning research.
					Our lab studies tools to make NLP technology more <b>efficient</b>, and to enhance the reporting of computational budgets.

			In recent years, deep learning became the leading machine learning technology in NLP.
			   Despite its wide adoption in NLP, the theory of deep learning 
			   lags behind its empirical success, as many engineered systems are in commercial use without a solid scientific basis for their operation.	   
			   Our research aims to <b>bridge the gap between theory and practice</b>.
			   I devise mathematical theories that link deep neural models to classical NLP models, such as weighted finite-state automata.

				We analyze the datasets on which NLP models are trained. 
				Looking carefully into these datasets, we uncover <i>limitations</i> and <i>biases</i> in the data collection process as well as the evaluation process.
				Our findings indicate that the recent success of neural models on many NLP tasks has been <b>overestimated</b>, and  pave the way for the development of <b>more reliable</b> methods of evaluation.
